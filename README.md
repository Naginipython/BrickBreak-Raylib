# Brick Break in Raylib
To run the project, you will need to install [Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/)\
Or you can run a custom build of your choice, but if you install Zig, here's how to run the program:

`zig build run` to build, and then run\
`zig build` and run the executable in `./zig-out/bin/[program]`

Should work on Windows and Linux, but was only currently tested in a Arch-based Linux environment
